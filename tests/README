==  Structures_DataGrid Unit Tests ==

To run the tests you need:
- PHP4 or PHP5
- PHPUnit >= 1.3.2 from http://phpunit.de/

For the SQL-based tests you need the sqlite extension (bundled by default
in PHP5)

You can run a group of tests:

$ php AllDataSourceTests.php

Or all:

$ php AllTests.php

If you have your Structures_DataGrid files in a special location, set the
include_path with something like:

$ php -d 'include_path=.:/special/location:/path/to/pear' AllTests.php

where /path/to/pear may be /usr/share/php if you're on a unix-like system.
